Glenn is invited in to talk about treasurer/ financial procedures. Glenn has set up a new bank account separate from his own and with a different bank. The account has free checking. Glenn explains how Venmo works, it is an app that one downloads and then set up to “private”. Other ways to donate, such as checks were also explained by Glenn. GR explained that contributions are used for the purchase of literature, group contributions to the WSO and ample reserve. Contributions are described as the “basket”. A motion was made and seconded to make “basket” procedures a part of our format. More discussion and a vote will take place at our next business meeting, April 7, 2022. A question was raised about how family group members living in other countries can contribute to the “basket”. Glenn will research this. We will have further discussion on April 7. Meeting was closed at 6:12AM with our Serenity Prayer.

Respectfully, Ed

Addendum: April 7 Business Meeting is cancelled. Time constraints prevented us from voting on this meeting.
