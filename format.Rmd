## (5) New business  

“Is there any new business that the group would like to discuss?”

- (item)	

- (item)	


## (6) Our Family Group’s Decisions on Voting

\* Our group votes before 6 am (because some regular members need to leave at 6 am). 

\* We encourage a thorough discussion, hearing all views. When a member proposes a major group change, we announce for 1 month at “announcements” - before we vote at the next business meeting (to give our members extra time to think before our family group votes).  

\* Our group uses a 2/3 vote. 

\* Our group decided that “yes” and “no” votes are counted. (“abstain” votes are not.)

(Abstentions, by definition, and those who remain silent are members who have decided not to vote. Attendees have shared many reasons for not voting: fell asleep, or think the issue is minor, or does not understand the proposal and therefore does not want to sway the vote in either direction, or not a member of this group and observing for educational purposes, and many other reasons, etc.)   

When Voting:  (Secretary can say the following…)

“All those in favor of this proposal for our family group?” “(name -yes1, etc…)(___\# in favor)”

“Is anyone opposed to this proposal?”  “(name -nay1, name -nay2…etc.)(_____\# opposed)”

“Would anyone like to abstain?”   “(name -abstain1, …etc)(____\# abstained)” 

“This proposal is approved (or opposed) with ___ \# in favor, ___ \# opposed, and ___ \# of abstentions.” (need to count the “yes” and “no” votes, then decide if it passed by a 2/3rds vote.)

### Sample Calculation: 

(2/3rds = 0.6);  For example, if 6-yes, 4-no, calculation 6+4=10 total, then 6/10=0.6 (yes passes).

If 5-yes, 5-no, calculation 5+5=10 total, then 5/10=0.5 (does not pass).

Our group decided on a 2/3 vote because this is closer to unanimous than half/half. (Tradition 12)

Calculation:  (Yes votes ÷ Total votes) > 0.6 (passes if greater than or equal to 0.6) (because 2/3 = 0.6)

“Would anyone like to add anything before closing?”

\* Our group uses the Al-Anon/Alateen Service Manual as a guide to answer group questions.

\* Our group can also reach out to our World Service Office (WSO) or we can ask a Delegate.
 
## (7)  Closing the Group Conscience (Business) Meeting: 

“Will all who care to join me in closing with the Serenity Prayer, please press \*1 to unmute.”

|“ **The Serenity Prayer:**|
|:---:|
|God grant me the serenity|
|To accept the things I cannot change|
|Courage to change the things I can|
|And wisdom to know the difference.”|

“This meeting is now formally closed. Thank you to everyone who participated. Our next meeting begins at 6:15 am.“
