# About the Group Business Meeting

The Group Business Meeting / Group Conscience is held during our regular meeting on the last day of each month at 5:00 a.m. for up to one (1) hour, as needed.

The Group Conscience is the result of the Group's Business Meeting discussions. The Group Conscience is the will of the Group. The guiding principles for the Group Conscience are always the 12 Traditions and the 12 Concepts of Service (please see 2022-2025 Al-Anon / Alateen Service Manual, pp. 48-49).
