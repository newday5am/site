<p>The Group Business Meeting / Group Conscience is held during our
regular meeting on the last day of each month at 5:00 a.m. for up to one
(1) hour, as needed.</p>
<p>The Group Conscience is the result of the Group’s Business Meeting
discussions. The Group Conscience is the will of the Group. The guiding
principles for the Group Conscience are always the 12 Traditions and the
12 Concepts of Service (please see 2022-2025 Al-Anon / Alateen Service
Manual, pp. 48-49).</p>

<p>All members are encouraged to share their knowledge, in order to make
informed Group Conscience decisions. We also encourage a thorough
discussion, hearing all views. Our Group uses the <a
href="https://al-anon.org/for-members/members-resources/manuals-and-guidelines/service-manual/">2022-2025
Al-Anon / Alateen Service Manual</a> as a guide to answer Group

<p>Group Representative Report: The GR reviewed our 3 priorities for the
Area and the fact that we have had no responses from our group for these
priorities. The GR read a letter from our Area Chair. An Area Assembly
Task Force has been formed. The formation of an electronic area is
unique and will require further discussion and consideration to
establish districts.</p>
<p>We discussed the first order of old business from the August 2022
Business Meeting that there should be no controversy over voting. A
motion was made and seconded that there always be a yes/no vote rather
than a “is anyone opposed” format. From now on there will be a
yes/no/abstain vote format. The motion passed with 11 yes, 2 no, 3
abstain.</p>
<p>The second order of old business from the August 2022 Business
Meeting, namely, to continue to discuss the calling of a group
conscience, was tabled for further clarification of the motion.</p>
<p>A request was made to discuss the inclusion of wording in our format
to invite the time-keeper to share first, and any other additional
wording that may be needed in the format.</p>
<p>At our October 2022 Business Meeting:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Our first order of old business will be to continue to discuss
the calling of a group conscience.</p></li>
<li><p>Our second order of old business is to discuss use of any
left-over time from our business meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Our third order of old business is a motion to discuss dominance
of readers and possible wording for our meeting format.</p></li>
<li><p>Our fourth order of old business is the wording of the format
with respect to the time-keeper and any additional needed
wording.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The business meeting ended at 6:02am with the Serenity prayer.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, SECRETARY.</p>
<p>Addendum: We seek a Business Meeting Chair for the next 3 to 6
months. This will be the first order of business at the next Business
Meeting after the monthly meeting chairs are filled.</p>

<p>Our group will contribute $32.41 to be divided between the WSO (70%)
and the Area (30%) this month.</p>
<p>The price of literature ordered through the WSO online store has
risen due to increased cost of materials, postage, and COVID-related
deficits. Our group treasury is now fully functioning under the
authority of our group conscience having spent many months of discussion
and voting. The treasury supports our newcomers with conference-approved
literature, contributes to our service arms, and provides our group with
a prudent reserve.</p>
<p>Group Representative Report:</p>
<p>Information about the WSO can be found on the website Al-Anon. Org.
The very first Global Electronic Area (GEA) Assembly meeting was held
July 31, 2022. WSO information can be read in three languages now:
Spanish, French and English. Our GEA delegate related his topics of
discussion from the World Service Conference. Among these are
recommendations for patience, time, work, and service with a focus on
gratitude. The average age of Al-Anon members is 62. Discussion at the
assembly meeting included how to attract younger members into service.
Our alternate GR also attended the Assembly meeting and offered her
perspective that gratitude was the focus. Unfortunately, not enough time
was allotted for member questions.</p>
<p>Our GR relayed three questions from our Area Chair who asked us to
consider:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are your top 3 priorities for the area?</li>
<li>How should districts be organized?</li>
<li>What service positions* are you willing and able to contribute?</li>
</ol>
<p>*Information about service positions can be found under Links of
Service in our Service Manual.</p>
<p>To date no responses from our group have been received. The GR
explained that her research consisted of reading responses on the GR
website from other groups. Some of her own thoughts were mirrored.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Electing an alternate delegate to the Area.</li>
<li>Create an area website to make Area information and activities
available to all members.</li>
<li>As we continue form our area, reach out to other areas to help us
understand what can and cannot work for our electronic area.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts on the formation of districts within our area include
categorizing groups according to time zones and electronic platforms
such as Zoom and telephone. There are currently 16 platforms and 800
registered groups in our area.</p>
<p>Our Chair and GR raised as an urgent priority an issue about voting,
as this substantially affects how we run our business meetings. The
Chair made a motion to discuss and vote on the way we format our votes.
The need for consistency was stressed. The motion is to always take a
yes or no vote of members present at the business meeting. We would no
longer take a vote by asking whether anyone is opposed. This practice
has been contested at every business meeting for the past several
months. Once established, the motion for a yes or no vote will save our
meeting precious time and avoid needless controversy. The motion was
tabled for the next business meeting.</p>
<p>There was a call for a discussion about “dominance” in terms of the
daily readings as well as possible wording for our meeting format.</p>
<p>At our September 2022 Business Meeting:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Our first order of old business as a priority will be to ask for a
second to the motion for a yes/no vote format, discuss the motion, vote
on the yes/no motion.</li>
<li>Our second order of old business will be to continue to discuss the
calling of a group conscience, upon which there will be a motion,
possible further discussion, and vote on this matter.</li>
<li>Our third order of old business is to discuss use of any left-over
time from our business meeting.</li>
<li>Our fourth order of old business is a motion to discuss dominance of
readers and possible wording for our meeting format.</li>
</ol>
<p>The business meeting ended at 6:02am with the Serenity prayer.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, SECRETARY.</p>

<h3>July 31, 2022</h3>
<p>Five AM New Day Al-Anon Family Group Meeting. July 31, 2022 Business
Meeting Minutes.</p>
<p>Business chair opened the meeting at 5AM. Meeting was opened with a
moment of silence followed by the Serenity Prayer.</p>
<p>Knowledge Based Decision Making (KBDM) will guide us through today’s
format.</p>
<p>Today’s business began with chairpersons for the month of August.
Sunday-MEMBER, Monday-MEMBER, Tuesday- MEMBER, Wednesday-MEMBER,
Thursday-MEMBER, Friday-MEMBER, Saturday-open.</p>
<p>Old business-Secretary read minutes from June 30, 2022 business
meeting.</p>
<p>Treasurer report- Ending balance in June $427.26. Receipts in July,
$35.00. Current balance of $462.26.</p>
<p>GR report- A Global Electronic Assembly Meeting will be held today.
Our GR will attend and bring information back to our group.</p>
<p>Business chair read literature on Knowledge Based Decision Making vs
Roberts Rules. Al-Anon currently uses the KBDM format.</p>
<p><strong>First order of old business:</strong> Treasurer would like to
bring to closure the $200 reserve amount. At the last business meeting,
a motion was made and seconded for the $200 reserve amount. Now we need
discussion and vote. Discussion was held and the vote was 18-yes,
zero-no and zero-abstain. Treasurer discussed the percentage of group
contributions in excess of the prudent reserve to be allocated to our
service arms, the World Service Office (WSO) and the Global Electronic
Area (GEA). The Service Manual suggests that our group contributions be
in proportion to the services provided. The treasurer recommends at this
time 70% to WSO and 30% to GEA, on a monthly basis. These percentages
may change as our GEA develops. A motion was made, seconded, and voted:
yes-13, no-zero, abstain-zero. The WSO announced that expenses per group
for services provided are $283/group, also known as the annual equalized
expense. Our goal is to contribute back to the WSO at least this amount
to be self-supporting. Now that the group treasury is fully formed, our
contributions support our Newcomers, WSO and Area. Our treasurer stated
that contributions have been received at the rate of 2-3 per month since
April. It is hoped that with the knowledge of where our group funds
support, our members will feel comfortable to contribute directly to our
family group.</p>
<p><strong>Second order of old business:</strong> Literature chairperson
discussion. This is not an anonymous position. Literature chair needs to
supply their address and phone number. Also, literature chair needs to
protect anonymity of person requesting packets. Our GR gave an overview
of the position. Time commitment, 3 months, 6 months, a year was
discussed. Also, rotation of service was discussed. Ellen volunteered
for this position. and will try it for 6 months. The vote for Ellen was
10-yes, zero-no and zero-abstain.</p>
<p><strong>Third order of old business:</strong> Use of any left-over
time from our business meeting. Suggestions are 1. Discussion of
tradition/concept of the month, 2. Daily readers, 3. Shares. The amount
of time left over can help determine the activity. We can always rotate
the activity. This item was tabled for further discussion at the next
Business Meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth order of old business:</strong> The GR raised the
question, when a member calls for a group conscience (that is, an
additional business meeting), how do we address this need? The proposal
is that a group conscience meeting request, due to the urgency and
gravity of such a request, cannot be tabled or postponed but must be
subject to an immediate vote for an additional meeting and its date and
time. Discussion at the next business meeting should include the timing
of the additional meeting (for example, 15 minutes before the close of
the designated meeting). It is suggested that the additional meeting
will take place after seven (7) days of announcing at daily meetings. An
example of an exception to this rule would be an impending deadline
within the seven-day window to meet a request from the WSO or GEA. This
